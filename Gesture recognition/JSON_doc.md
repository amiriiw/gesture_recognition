## What is JSON library?
    
The JSON library in programming refers to a module/library that provides functions to encode and decode data in the JSON
(JavaScript Object Notation) format. It allows for easy serialization and deserialization of data structures to and from
JSON format.


## Why do we use JSON library?
    
We use the JSON library in programming to work with JSON data, which is a lightweight data interchange format commonly 
used for transmitting data between a server and a web application. It simplifies data exchange and storage by providing 
a standardized format that is easy to read and write for both humans and machines.


## advantages of JSON library?
    
Advantages of using the JSON library include:

- Data interchange: It enables seamless data exchange between different systems and platforms.


- Human-readable format: JSON data is easy to read and write, making it popular for configuration files and web APIs.
  

- Language independence: JSON is supported by many programming languages, making it a versatile choice for data serialization.


## disadvantages of JSON library?

Disadvantages of using the JSON library may include:

- Limited data types: JSON has limited support for complex data types compared to other serialization formats.


- Lack of schema enforcement: JSON does not enforce a strict schema, which can lead to potential data validation issues.

  
## Summary about JSON library:

In summary, the JSON library is a widely used tool in programming for working with JSON data, providing functions to 
encode and decode data structures in a standardized format. It simplifies data interchange, is human-readable, and 
language-independent, but may have limitations in data types and schema enforcement.
